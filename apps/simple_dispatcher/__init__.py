"""Simple dispatcher service.

This module provides a very small standâ€‘in implementation used by the
integration tests.  The real project dispatches tasks to a queue and later
invokes agent services.  For the purposes of the exercises we merely record
the enqueue request and return a confirmation dictionary.
